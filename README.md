# This repository is for task #2 given in GRIP July, 2021 by The Sparks Foundation.
# The task is to find the optimum number of clusters for the given Iris dataset and then represent them visually.
# We have used the KMeans algorithm in Python to divide the dataset into clusters.
# We use the elbow method to find the optimum number of clusters.
# Then, we visualize the clusters using scatterplots.
