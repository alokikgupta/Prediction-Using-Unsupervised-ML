# Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
This repository is for task #2 I worked on as a Data Science And Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation, in GRIP July, 2021.</p>
The task is to find the optimum number of clusters for the given Iris dataset and then represent them visually.
We have used the KMeans algorithm in Python to divide the dataset into clusters.
We use the elbow method to find the optimum number of clusters.
Then, we visualize the clusters using scatterplots.

<b>Programming Language used </b>: Python</p>
<b>Libraries used </b>: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
